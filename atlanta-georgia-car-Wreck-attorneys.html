                <p class="content1 text-white blackPara"  >  <br>Work With Experts – We work with other experts, such as doctors (to explain your injuries to the judge). Other experts include accident recreation experts, forensic experts, and others. Moreover, we work with professional insurance appraisal experts to determine the true worth of your injuries, damages, and losses. At Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C., we value expert input, so that we can deliver the best.  <br>Negotiate With Insurance Companies – Do you know that a majority of personal injury cases are solved out of court? Because of this, insurance companies always want to settle the cases first to offer lower amounts and save money. However, since we will first work on determining the true worth of your case, we will help you negotiate with the company to get the true worth of your case.  <br>Case Preparation -  Not all cases are saved through negotiations. Sometimes negotiations fail, and in this case, it must be solved by a civil court. Our lawyers will represent you in court. We will help you find witnesses to testify, including expert witnesses such as doctors, forensic experts, and others. <br>How Much Is My Case Worth? The amount of compensation you will get depends on your case. In other words, every case is different, including the facts of the case. As such, the case will be influenced by several factors that include the severity of the injuries, lost income, recovery time, and more. As such, we will help you recover compensation for: -<br>Medical Bills – We will help you obtain compensation for all your past and future medical expenses. This will cover everything, like rehabilitation expenses, in-home care, hospital bills, and others. Emotional Suffering And Physical Pain – An accident victim is eligible to receive compensation for physical pain and emotional anguish. Lost Wages – Because injuries limit a person’s ability to work, a person can recover compensation for the lost wages. Some injuries may limit your ability to earn the amount you previously did (reduce earning capacity). Punitive Damages – If the accident came about through a malicious act, you may be able to receive punitive damage. Punitive damage is awarded as a way to punish the offender. <br>What If I Have Been Injured In A Motorcycle Accident? Just like car accidents, motorcycle accidents fall under personal injury cases, and you are entitled to receive compensation for the accident. Motorcycle accident cases are also filed against the negligent party who are negligent and fail to obey traffic rules.<br>Are Motorcycle Cases Subject To PIP Regulations? According to Georgia law, motorcycle owners are not required to purchase PIP insurance. As such, motorcycle riders are not required to satisfy the PIP requirements like car drivers.

                <p class="content3"> <br>Injured individuals do not have the energy to argue. Moreover, some medications can make it difficult to think. An auto accident lawyer understands these subtle tricks and will be able to defend your rights. This can save you valuable time and money. The insurance company may even take advantage of your inexperienced state to get a settlement. So, you should always hire an auto accident lawyer who understands the nuances of insurance company's strategy.<br>Cost of hiring a lawyer - The cost of hiring an auto accident attorney depends on the type of accident and the lawyer. While small accidents may be settled by the parties involved, larger ones may require the services of a lawyer. Insurance companies may try to pressurize you into accepting an early settlement, so you may need to hire an attorney to fight against them. Your attorney will charge $100 - $500 per hour depending on the type of accident and the lawyer's experience.<br>The cost of an auto accident lawyer can run into the thousands of dollars, depending on the type of case and the jurisdiction. However, it shouldn't discourage you from filing a claim. Many law firms have different ways to charge accident costs. Large firms usually deduct the cost from the settlement, while smaller ones may require you to pay costs as they arise. You can negotiate payment terms with your lawyer, however, to ensure you pay the least possible amount.<br>A contingency retainer plan is a hybrid approach to payment for an attorney. In this case, a client pays a retainer to the lawyer before the case begins. The retainer, which is generally equal to 30% of the total settlement amount, is subtracted from the remaining amount. The retainer is essentially an advance on the case. If your case settles for USD $100,000, the lawyer will receive approximately $31,000, while you will get the remaining USD 14,000, or approximately $11,000 (depending on the lawyer).<br>Another way to reduce the cost of hiring an auto accident lawyer is to negotiate a settlement. Many insurance companies offer settlements for small settlements, which are often worth less than the attorney's fee. A settlement of $5,000 - $25,000 is usually enough to compensate a person for their injuries. If the insurance company is the at-fault party, it is important to seek compensation for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.<br>Benefits of hiring a lawyer -  A car accident lawyer has several benefits. For one thing, they know the law and can help you navigate the complex settlement process. Oftentimes, insurance companies will say that the injuries you have suffered are minor or are the result of an underlying condition. Hiring a car accident lawyer will help you avoid these situations and make the legal process easier to handle. An auto accident attorney can help you deal with insurance companies, which can be a daunting task. </p>
