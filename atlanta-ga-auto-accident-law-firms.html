                <p class="content1 text-white blackPara"  >  <br>Teenage Drivers – Most young drivers don’t know what to do when in an unsafe condition resulting in auto accidents. Without proper defensive driving courses, they wouldn’t know what to do. Drugs – Any driver under the influence of drugs such as prescription pills, marijuana and other illegal substances is also at a huge risk of causing an accident.  Potholes – When on the road, it can be quite frustrating especially when you can’t avoid a pothole. Most drivers tend to swerve into the other lane to avoid a pothole thus causing an accident. Tire Blowouts – If your car gets a flat tire when you are on the road you will start swerving unexpectedly and might likely cause an auto accident. <br>Animal Crossings – If you don’t watch out for the street signs showing animal crossings, you might end up hitting an animal while on the road resulting in a terrible accident.  Construction Sites – If you are driving in a construction zone, you might be feeling confused. If you don’t follow the cones or notice the other confused drivers, you might end up in a serious accident.  If you have been involved in an auto accident because of any of these reasons, you need to contact our law firm immediately. <br>Types Of Atlanta Auto Accidents We Handle  - When you approach us after being involved in an auto accident, we will try our best to prove negligence so you can receive the right amount of compensation.

You can take a cab home or ask a friend to drive you home. Always stick to the speeding limits to avoid over speeding. You need to remain calm when driving to avoid any auto accidents caused by reckless driving.<br>When driving in terrible weather conditions, it makes sense to pull over and wait until the bad weather passes. Never run any red lights. You should always stop even if there are no other cars on the road. Avoid driving at night. Take your car for regular maintenance to identify any design effects before you cause a serious accident.<br>If you are a young driver, you should go through a defensive driving course and avoid using cell phones when driving. Also, you limit the amount of people in the vehicle when you are driving. Never drive when under the influence of drugs such as marijuana or prescription pills. Take note of all the signs on the road, especially animal crossings to avoid hitting animals when on the road.</p>

A lot of things can occur when different drivers are on the highway. A driver could decide to consider their phone while taking their eyes off of the road for a few seconds. However, during those couple of seconds while they are failing to pay attention, that driver might have slammed straight into your vehicle. The impact from the crash might have caused you to be prone to serious injuries.

No matter what happened, we shall work challenging to the bottom of it. Our law practice takes all cases seriously. Working on Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It After we have a lot of the details that you may have provided, we would like to recreate the accident scene. We could enlist professional help from experts that know how to reconstruct a model of the accident scene that shows just how the vehicles were before, during, and right after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene would come with all of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that were posted at the intersection. The main reason for having the accident scene reconstructed is to supply a full visual of the happened and how it happened. Surveillance footage might not be available when accidents occur, so the reconstructed scene is the next most sensible thing. When there is high-quality surveillance footage of your accident, it is actually better yet. Now that more business owners and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras beyond their properties, it really is easier than it had been before to locate footage from the accident.

We do this because we would like to have just as much evidence when we can find to back up any claim you will be making from the other driver to obtain compensation for the damages.</p>

On the other hand, a victim can be able to recover compensation from their personal injury protection insurance policy. <br>What Do I Need To Know About Georgia’s Personal Injury Protection Insurance (PIP)? All drivers are required to have a Personal Injury Protection insurance; according to the traffic laws of Georgia. The best thing about PIP insurance is that it offers benefits to accident victims regardless of who was at fault for the accident. That is why it is also referred to as ‘no-fault’ insurance. The only condition to getting the benefits under the PIP insurance policy is – the victim must receive medical treatment within fourteen days. <br>Aside from getting insurance benefits that are more than $2,500, the victim must be receiving treatment for an emergency medical condition’. Georgia law defines an emergency medical condition as a medical condition that demands immediate medical attention and can reasonably be expected to be fatal to a victim’s health. Our lawyers will work closely with your insurance company to ensure that you get all the PIP benefits you are legally allowed. To know more about Georgia’s PIP programs, click here. </p>
