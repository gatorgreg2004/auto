                <p class="yacss-text yacss-fonts-style mb-0 display-7"><p>While it might seem overwhelming to answer countless questions, you should provide us with just as much information as you can. We would like to aid you with your case, so we need to know how things occurred and who could possibly have witnessed the accident firsthand. When you can find witnesses involved that may vouch for yourself and give statements from the other driver, it really is a great thing because it makes it easier for people like us to prove that you will be owed compensation from your other driver because of the wrongdoings. Many things can occur when different drivers are on the road. A driver could decide to think about their phone while taking their eyes off of the road for several seconds. However, during those few seconds while they are failing to pay attention, that driver could possibly have slammed directly into your vehicle. The impact of your crash may have caused you to be prone to serious injuries. Whether or not the driver had not been distracted by the phone, they could have been driving while underneath the influence or speeding because they were running late for work. Regardless of what happened, we are going to work hard to get to the bottom of it. Our law firm takes all cases seriously. Concentrating on Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It After we have many of the details that you may have provided, we would like to recreate the accident scene. We could enlist specialized help from experts that know how to reconstruct a model of the accident scene that shows the way the vehicles were before, during, and soon after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene would include all of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that have been posted on the intersection. The principal function of finding the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of the items happened and the way it happened. Surveillance footage may not be available when accidents occur, hence the reconstructed scene is the next smartest thing. If you find high-quality surveillance footage in the accident, it is better yet. Seeing that more company owners and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras beyond their properties, it is easier than it was actually before to find footage in the accident. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the accident was caught on camera, but we are going to work difficult to find out if some of the home owners in the area possess footage relating to the accident that you were involved with. We do this because we want to have as much evidence as we can discover to aid any claim you will be making from the other driver to get compensation for that damages.</p>

All drivers are required to have a Personal Injury Protection insurance; according to the traffic laws of Georgia. The best thing about PIP insurance is that it offers benefits to accident victims regardless of who was at fault for the accident. That is why it is also referred to as ‘no-fault’ insurance. The only condition to getting the benefits under the PIP insurance policy is – the victim must receive medical treatment within fourteen days. <br>Aside from getting insurance benefits that are more than $2,500, the victim must be receiving treatment for an emergency medical condition’. Georgia law defines an emergency medical condition as a medical condition that demands immediate medical attention and can reasonably be expected to be fatal to a victim’s health. Our lawyers will work closely with your insurance company to ensure that you get all the PIP benefits you are legally allowed. To know more about Georgia’s PIP programs, click here.  </p>
