                <p class="yacss-text yacss-fonts-style mb-0 display-7"><p>While it may seem overwhelming to respond to so many questions, you have to give us all the information that you can. We would like to help you with your case, so we have to know how things occurred and who could possibly have witnessed the accident firsthand. When there are actually witnesses involved that may vouch for you personally and offer statements from the other driver, this is a good thing because it makes it easier for people to prove that you will be owed compensation through the other driver because of the wrongdoings. Numerous things can happen when different drivers are on your way. A driver could decide to consider their phone while taking their eyes away from the road for a couple seconds. However, during those few seconds if they are failing to pay attention, that driver might have slammed right into your car. The impact of the crash might have caused you to be prone to serious injuries. Even when the driver was not distracted with the phone, they could have been driving while within the influence or speeding mainly because they were running late for work. Whatever happened, we shall work hard to get to the bottom of it. Our lawyer takes all cases seriously. Focusing on Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It After we have most of the details that you may have provided, we want to recreate the accident scene. We could enlist specialist help from experts that realize how to reconstruct a model from the accident scene that shows the way the vehicles were before, during, and right after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene would include all of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs which were posted on the intersection. The primary reason for finding the accident scene reconstructed is to supply a full visual of the things happened and just how it happened. Surveillance footage may not be available when accidents occur, therefore the reconstructed scene is definitely the next best thing. When there is high-quality surveillance footage of your accident, it is actually much better. Now that more business people and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras outside of their properties, it really is easier than it had been before to find footage of the accident. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee how the accident was caught on camera, but we shall work difficult to find out if some of the property owners in the region have any footage concerning the accident you had been involved in. We all do this because we should have the maximum amount of evidence as we can see to aid any claim you will be making versus the other driver to have compensation for your damages.</p>

Drugs – Any driver under the influence of drugs such as prescription pills, marijuana and other illegal substances is also at a huge risk of causing an accident.  Potholes – When on the road, it can be quite frustrating especially when you can’t avoid a pothole. Most drivers tend to swerve into the other lane to avoid a pothole thus causing an accident. Tire Blowouts – If your car gets a flat tire when you are on the road you will start swerving unexpectedly and might likely cause an auto accident. <br>Animal Crossings – If you don’t watch out for the street signs showing animal crossings, you might end up hitting an animal while on the road resulting in a terrible accident.  Construction Sites – If you are driving in a construction zone, you might be feeling confused. If you don’t follow the cones or notice the other confused drivers, you might end up in a serious accident.

That is because the specifics of the cases are different in Atlanta. On the other hand, you can only file a lawsuit if the accident was a result of the other party’s negligence. Also, vehicle and car part manufacturers can be held liable for a car accident and even municipalities (road building and maintenance organizations). A driver can only be held liable; if they fail to exercise reasonable care. A few examples include: <br>Tailgating, Failing to obey traffic rules (such as red lights, stop signs, driving maximum speed, and others, Speeding, Driving while under the influence, Failing to keep an eye on the road and Failing to yield to traffic with the right of way.<br>The severity of the injury is another factor that determines if you have a case or not. According to Georgia law, those that meet specific car accident conditions can legally file a car accident claim. On the other hand, a victim can be able to recover compensation from their personal injury protection insurance policy. <br>What Do I Need To Know About Georgia’s Personal Injury Protection Insurance (PIP)? All drivers are required to have a Personal Injury Protection insurance; according to the traffic laws of Georgia. The best thing about PIP insurance is that it offers benefits to accident victims regardless of who was at fault for the accident. That is why it is also referred to as ‘no-fault’ insurance. The only condition to getting the benefits under the PIP insurance policy is – the victim must receive medical treatment within fourteen days. <br>Aside from getting insurance benefits that are more than $2,500, the victim must be receiving treatment for an emergency medical condition’. Georgia law defines an emergency medical condition as a medical condition that demands immediate medical attention and can reasonably be expected to be fatal to a victim’s health. Our lawyers will work closely with your insurance company to ensure that you get all the PIP benefits you are legally allowed. To know more about Georgia’s PIP programs, click here. </p>

You can take a cab home or ask a friend to drive you home. Always stick to the speeding limits to avoid over speeding. You need to remain calm when driving to avoid any auto accidents caused by reckless driving.<br>When driving in terrible weather conditions, it makes sense to pull over and wait until the bad weather passes. Never run any red lights. You should always stop even if there are no other cars on the road. Avoid driving at night. Take your car for regular maintenance to identify any design effects before you cause a serious accident.<br>If you are a young driver, you should go through a defensive driving course and avoid using cell phones when driving. Also, you limit the amount of people in the vehicle when you are driving. Never drive when under the influence of drugs such as marijuana or prescription pills. Take note of all the signs on the road, especially animal crossings to avoid hitting animals when on the road.  </p>
