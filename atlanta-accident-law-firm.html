Avoid taking calls, texting, eating, reading or grooming yourself when behind the wheel. Never get behind the wheel when you are intoxicated. You can take a cab home or ask a friend to drive you home. Always stick to the speeding limits to avoid over speeding. You need to remain calm when driving to avoid any auto accidents caused by reckless driving.<br>When driving in terrible weather conditions, it makes sense to pull over and wait until the bad weather passes. Never run any red lights. You should always stop even if there are no other cars on the road. Avoid driving at night. Take your car for regular maintenance to identify any design effects before you cause a serious accident.<br>If you are a young driver, you should go through a defensive driving course and avoid using cell phones when driving. Also, you limit the amount of people in the vehicle when you are driving. Never drive when under the influence of drugs such as marijuana or prescription pills. Take note of all the signs on the road, especially animal crossings to avoid hitting animals when on the road.

                <p> <br>Teenage Drivers – Most young drivers don’t know what to do when in an unsafe condition resulting in auto accidents. Without proper defensive driving courses, they wouldn’t know what to do. Drugs – Any driver under the influence of drugs such as prescription pills, marijuana and other illegal substances is also at a huge risk of causing an accident.  Potholes – When on the road, it can be quite frustrating especially when you can’t avoid a pothole. Most drivers tend to swerve into the other lane to avoid a pothole thus causing an accident. Tire Blowouts – If your car gets a flat tire when you are on the road you will start swerving unexpectedly and might likely cause an auto accident. <br>Animal Crossings – If you don’t watch out for the street signs showing animal crossings, you might end up hitting an animal while on the road resulting in a terrible accident.  Construction Sites – If you are driving in a construction zone, you might be feeling confused. If you don’t follow the cones or notice the other confused drivers, you might end up in a serious accident.  If you have been involved in an auto accident because of any of these reasons, you need to contact our law firm immediately. <br>Types Of Atlanta Auto Accidents We Handle  - When you approach us after being involved in an auto accident, we will try our best to prove negligence so you can receive the right amount of compensation.

We wish to support you with your case, so we must learn how things occurred and who might have witnessed the accident firsthand. When there are witnesses involved that may vouch for yourself and supply statements versus the other driver, it really is a good thing because it makes it easier for all of us to prove you are owed compensation from the other driver because of their wrongdoings. Many things can occur when different drivers are on the highway. A driver could decide to look at their phone while taking their eyes away from the road for a few seconds. However, during those few seconds if they are not paying attention, that driver could have slammed straight into your car. The impact in the crash could have caused you to be affected by serious injuries. Even if your driver had not been distracted through the phone, they could have been driving while within the influence or speeding mainly because they were running late for work. No matter what happened, we are going to work difficult to get to the foot of it. Our law office takes all cases seriously. Focusing on Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It Once we have the vast majority of details you have provided, we wish to recreate the accident scene. We can easily enlist specialized help from experts that know how to reconstruct one from the accident scene that shows exactly how the vehicles were before, during, and immediately after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene would include each of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that have been posted at the intersection. The key reason for obtaining the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of the happened and just how it happened. Surveillance footage may not be available when accidents occur, and so the reconstructed scene is the next best thing. When there is high-quality surveillance footage in the accident, it is actually better yet. Seeing that more business owners and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras beyond their properties, it is actually easier than it was actually before to locate footage in the accident. Unfortunately, there is not any guarantee that this accident was caught on camera, but we are going to work difficult to get out if the home owners in the area possess any footage relating to the accident that you were associated with. Perform this because we wish to have the maximum amount of evidence while we can discover to assist any claim you might be making versus the other driver to have compensation to the damages.</p>

That is because the specifics of the cases are different in Atlanta. On the other hand, you can only file a lawsuit if the accident was a result of the other party’s negligence. Also, vehicle and car part manufacturers can be held liable for a car accident and even municipalities (road building and maintenance organizations). A driver can only be held liable; if they fail to exercise reasonable care. A few examples include: <br>Tailgating, Failing to obey traffic rules (such as red lights, stop signs, driving maximum speed, and others, Speeding, Driving while under the influence, Failing to keep an eye on the road and Failing to yield to traffic with the right of way.<br>The severity of the injury is another factor that determines if you have a case or not. According to Georgia law, those that meet specific car accident conditions can legally file a car accident claim. On the other hand, a victim can be able to recover compensation from their personal injury protection insurance policy. <br>What Do I Need To Know About Georgia’s Personal Injury Protection Insurance (PIP)? All drivers are required to have a Personal Injury Protection insurance; according to the traffic laws of Georgia. The best thing about PIP insurance is that it offers benefits to accident victims regardless of who was at fault for the accident. That is why it is also referred to as ‘no-fault’ insurance. The only condition to getting the benefits under the PIP insurance policy is – the victim must receive medical treatment within fourteen days. <br>Aside from getting insurance benefits that are more than $2,500, the victim must be receiving treatment for an emergency medical condition’. Georgia law defines an emergency medical condition as a medical condition that demands immediate medical attention and can reasonably be expected to be fatal to a victim’s health. Our lawyers will work closely with your insurance company to ensure that you get all the PIP benefits you are legally allowed. To know more about Georgia’s PIP programs, click here.  </p>
