Nugent, P.C., we value expert input, so that we can deliver the best.  <br>Negotiate With Insurance Companies – Do you know that a majority of personal injury cases are solved out of court?

Nugent, P.C., we advise all our clients to reject the first compensation offer given by insurance companies. In fact, you should not even talk to the representatives of the insurance company.

                <p class="content3">  <br>Injured individuals do not have the energy to argue. Moreover, some medications can make it difficult to think. An auto accident lawyer understands these subtle tricks and will be able to defend your rights. This can save you valuable time and money. The insurance company may even take advantage of your inexperienced state to get a settlement. So, you should always hire an auto accident lawyer who understands the nuances of insurance company's strategy.<br>Cost of hiring a lawyer - The cost of hiring an auto accident attorney depends on the type of accident and the lawyer. While small accidents may be settled by the parties involved, larger ones may require the services of a lawyer. Insurance companies may try to pressurize you into accepting an early settlement, so you may need to hire an attorney to fight against them. Your attorney will charge $100 - $500 per hour depending on the type of accident and the lawyer's experience.<br>The cost of an auto accident lawyer can run into the thousands of dollars, depending on the type of case and the jurisdiction. However, it shouldn't discourage you from filing a claim. Many law firms have different ways to charge accident costs. Large firms usually deduct the cost from the settlement, while smaller ones may require you to pay costs as they arise. You can negotiate payment terms with your lawyer, however, to ensure you pay the least possible amount.<br>A contingency retainer plan is a hybrid approach to payment for an attorney. In this case, a client pays a retainer to the lawyer before the case begins. The retainer, which is generally equal to 30% of the total settlement amount, is subtracted from the remaining amount. The retainer is essentially an advance on the case. If your case settles for USD $100,000, the lawyer will receive approximately $31,000, while you will get the remaining USD 14,000, or approximately $11,000 (depending on the lawyer).<br>Another way to reduce the cost of hiring an auto accident lawyer is to negotiate a settlement. Many insurance companies offer settlements for small settlements, which are often worth less than the attorney's fee. A settlement of $5,000 - $25,000 is usually enough to compensate a person for their injuries. If the insurance company is the at-fault party, it is important to seek compensation for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.<br>Benefits of hiring a lawyer -  A car accident lawyer has several benefits. For one thing, they know the law and can help you navigate the complex settlement process. Oftentimes, insurance companies will say that the injuries you have suffered are minor or are the result of an underlying condition. Hiring a car accident lawyer will help you avoid these situations and make the legal process easier to handle. An auto accident attorney can help you deal with insurance companies, which can be a daunting task.</p>

                <p class="content6"> <br>What Are The Main Causes Of Auto Accidents? Over the last 25 years, we have handled auto accidents in Atlanta that have been caused by any of the following things.  Distracted Driving – Here, the driver does not pay attention to the road while driving. The driver might be answering a call, texting, eating, reading, grooming and applying makeup or talking when driving resulting in an accident.  Drunk Driving – A lot of accidents in Atlanta have been caused by people who get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. <br>Speeding – Drivers who are running late, often tend to overspeed and will most likely cause an auto accident.  Reckless Driving – A reckless driver will usually change lanes too quickly or act aggressively while behind the wheel. If a driver is not calm behind the wheel, he/she will most likely cause serious accidents. Rain – If you don’t know how to drive in the rain, you should avoid it. That’s because it can cause slippery and treacherous road conditions. It’s ideal to wait for the storm to pass before getting back on the road again. <br>Running Red Lights – When you are on the road, you should always stop at red lights even if there aren’t other cares coming. By running a red light, you are increasing your chances of getting an accident and you will also be breaking the law. Driving At Night – It’s very difficult to drive at night because there is low visibility. If you must drive at night, make sure you are extra alert.  Design Defects – In some instances, accidents can be caused by flaws in the vehicle itself. It’s unpreventable bust very disastrous when it happens.<br>Tailgaiting – It refers to following the car in front of you very closely. While driving you need to stay a safe distance away from the vehicle in front of you to avoid any auto accidents especially in the event of sudden stops. Driving The Wrong Way Or Taking Improper Turns – A lot of drivers often make mistakes while on the road but having a lapse in judgment can result in a very serious accident. Failure to note the street signs especially for one-way streets or any other irregularities will result in an auto accident.  </p>
