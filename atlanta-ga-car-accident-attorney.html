Whatever happened, we are going to work challenging to the bottom of it. Our law firm takes all cases seriously.

The reconstructed accident scene would include all of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that were posted on the intersection. The key intent behind obtaining the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of what happened and exactly how it happened. Surveillance footage might not be available when accidents occur, hence the reconstructed scene will be the next smartest thing.

                <p class="content6"> <br>Cost of hiring an Attorney in Atlanta -  You're probably wondering how much it costs to hire an auto accident lawyer. The fees for a lawyer vary considerably depending on the circumstances of your case. While a flat fee may be acceptable for one-time tasks like demand letters, you might need to hire a lawyer for more complicated cases. Fortunately, many car accident attorneys work on contingency basis, which means you can avoid the high upfront fees. Below are some of the things you should keep in mind when hiring an auto accident attorney.<br>First, you must understand the fees that will be charged for filing a case. Depending on the type of case, costs could range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. However, you should keep in mind that the cost of hiring an auto accident attorney should not deter you from filing a claim. The fees you pay for your attorney are typically deducted from the settlement you receive. Smaller law firms may require you to pay them as they arise. However, you can always negotiate payment terms with your attorney. You should remember that you only get one chance to recover compensation from a car accident. If you are not able to get a fair settlement, you may be forced to accept less money than you deserve. A good auto accident lawyer will negotiate on your behalf with the insurance company to maximize your compensation. This can be a frustrating and time-consuming process, but it's a valuable investment in your recovery. So, how do you choose between discount attorneys and a qualified auto accident lawyer?<br>If you hire a car accident attorney on contingency, you'll be paying them on a percentage of the settlement amount. This fee can range from 25 to 40 percent, depending on where you live and what kind of lawyer you hire. You'll also likely have to pay a retainer if you want your case to be a success. However, it's not uncommon to be able to recover at least thirty percent of your settlement through a contingency fee. </p>

                <p class="content3"><br>Teenage Drivers – Most young drivers don’t know what to do when in an unsafe condition resulting in auto accidents. Without proper defensive driving courses, they wouldn’t know what to do. Drugs – Any driver under the influence of drugs such as prescription pills, marijuana and other illegal substances is also at a huge risk of causing an accident.  Potholes – When on the road, it can be quite frustrating especially when you can’t avoid a pothole. Most drivers tend to swerve into the other lane to avoid a pothole thus causing an accident. Tire Blowouts – If your car gets a flat tire when you are on the road you will start swerving unexpectedly and might likely cause an auto accident. <br>Animal Crossings – If you don’t watch out for the street signs showing animal crossings, you might end up hitting an animal while on the road resulting in a terrible accident.  Construction Sites – If you are driving in a construction zone, you might be feeling confused. If you don’t follow the cones or notice the other confused drivers, you might end up in a serious accident.  If you have been involved in an auto accident because of any of these reasons, you need to contact our law firm immediately. <br>Types Of Atlanta Auto Accidents We Handle  - When you approach us after being involved in an auto accident, we will try our best to prove negligence so you can receive the right amount of compensation.
