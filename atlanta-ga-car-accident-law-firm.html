We wish to assist you with your case, so we must understand how things occurred and who might have witnessed the accident firsthand. When there are witnesses involved that may vouch for yourself and offer statements versus the other driver, this is a great thing since it makes it much simpler for us to prove you are owed compensation through the other driver because of the wrongdoings. A lot of things could happen when different drivers are on your way. A driver could decide to consider their phone while taking their eyes off the road for several seconds. However, during those couple of seconds when they are not paying attention, that driver may have slammed right into your car or truck. The impact in the crash could have caused you to be prone to serious injuries. Even if the driver had not been distracted through the phone, they might have been driving while beneath the influence or speeding because they were running late for work. No matter what happened, we will work hard to get to the bottom of it. Our lawyer takes all cases seriously. Focusing on Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It After we have many of the details you have provided, we should recreate the accident scene. We are able to enlist specialized help from experts that realize how to reconstruct a model in the accident scene that shows how the vehicles were before, during, and immediately after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene includes all the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that were posted with the intersection. The main intent behind getting the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of the items happened and exactly how it happened. Surveillance footage is not always available when accidents occur, and so the reconstructed scene is definitely the next best thing. If you have high-quality surveillance footage in the accident, it can be better yet. Since more companies and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras away from their properties, it can be easier than it was before to get footage in the accident. Unfortunately, there is not any guarantee that the accident was caught on camera, but we will work difficult to get out if some of the home owners in the area have footage concerning the accident you had been associated with. We do this because we want to have the maximum amount of evidence when we can see to support any claim you are making versus the other driver to get compensation to the damages.</p>
