                <p class="content1 text-white blackPara"  >  <br>Work With Experts – We work with other experts, such as doctors (to explain your injuries to the judge). Other experts include accident recreation experts, forensic experts, and others. Moreover, we work with professional insurance appraisal experts to determine the true worth of your injuries, damages, and losses. At Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C., we value expert input, so that we can deliver the best.  <br>Negotiate With Insurance Companies – Do you know that a majority of personal injury cases are solved out of court? Because of this, insurance companies always want to settle the cases first to offer lower amounts and save money. However, since we will first work on determining the true worth of your case, we will help you negotiate with the company to get the true worth of your case.  <br>Case Preparation -  Not all cases are saved through negotiations. Sometimes negotiations fail, and in this case, it must be solved by a civil court. Our lawyers will represent you in court. We will help you find witnesses to testify, including expert witnesses such as doctors, forensic experts, and others. <br>How Much Is My Case Worth? The amount of compensation you will get depends on your case. In other words, every case is different, including the facts of the case. As such, the case will be influenced by several factors that include the severity of the injuries, lost income, recovery time, and more. As such, we will help you recover compensation for: -<br>Medical Bills – We will help you obtain compensation for all your past and future medical expenses. This will cover everything, like rehabilitation expenses, in-home care, hospital bills, and others. Emotional Suffering And Physical Pain – An accident victim is eligible to receive compensation for physical pain and emotional anguish. Lost Wages – Because injuries limit a person’s ability to work, a person can recover compensation for the lost wages. Some injuries may limit your ability to earn the amount you previously did (reduce earning capacity). Punitive Damages – If the accident came about through a malicious act, you may be able to receive punitive damage. Punitive damage is awarded as a way to punish the offender. <br>What If I Have Been Injured In A Motorcycle Accident? Just like car accidents, motorcycle accidents fall under personal injury cases, and you are entitled to receive compensation for the accident. Motorcycle accident cases are also filed against the negligent party who are negligent and fail to obey traffic rules.<br>Are Motorcycle Cases Subject To PIP Regulations? According to Georgia law, motorcycle owners are not required to purchase PIP insurance. As such, motorcycle riders are not required to satisfy the PIP requirements like car drivers.

We would like to support you with your case, so we have to learn how things occurred and who may have witnessed the accident firsthand. When there are witnesses involved that could vouch for yourself and provide statements against the other driver, it is a great thing since it makes it easier for people like us to prove that you will be owed compensation from your other driver due to their wrongdoings. Many things can occur when different drivers are on your way. A driver could decide to think about their phone while taking their eyes away from the road for several seconds. However, during those few seconds while they are failing to pay attention, that driver could have slammed directly into your car. The impact of your crash may have caused you to be affected by serious injuries. Even if the driver had not been distracted by the phone, they could have been driving while within the influence or speeding since they were running late for work. No matter what happened, we shall work hard to get to the base of it. Our law practice takes all cases seriously. Taking care of Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It Once we have many of the details which you have provided, we wish to recreate the accident scene. We can enlist specialized help from experts that understand how to reconstruct one of the accident scene that shows how the vehicles were before, during, and right after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene would include all of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that were posted in the intersection. The primary intent behind obtaining the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of the happened and just how it happened. Surveillance footage may not be available when accidents occur, so the reconstructed scene is definitely the next smartest thing. If there is high-quality surveillance footage of the accident, it can be even better. Since more companies and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras away from their properties, it is actually easier than it had been before to locate footage of the accident. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no guarantee that the accident was caught on camera, but we are going to work hard to find out if any one of the property owners in the community have any footage relating to the accident you have been involved in. Perform this because we should have as much evidence since we can see to assist any claim you will be making from the other driver to obtain compensation to the damages.</p>

                <p class="content3"> <br>Non-economic or intangible losses are covered under general damages. You don't need to have proof of a specific amount of harm to claim these damages. You should prove the mental and emotional damages through medical documentation as well as testimony from expert witnesses. Examples of general damages are: Emotional suffering and distress,  Physical pain,  Mental anguish,  Diminished capacity to earn a living,  PSTD or post-traumatic stress disorder,  Lost quality of life,  and Missed opportunities in the workplace.<br>GA Auto Accident Laws -  The auto accident claim process looks different from state to state. You should consult the Atlanta Police Department if you or someone in your family is involved in an auto accident that results in more than $500 property damage, death or injury to any party. There are three locations in Atlanta where you can file your auto accident claim. The State Court of Fulton County has jurisdiction in all civil cases in Atlanta. If the claim is less than $15,000, you need to file your case with the Magistrate Court of Fulton County. <br>Car Insurance Needs - Every vehicle owner in Atlanta should have auto insurance with minimum requirements. The requirements include $25,000 for bodily injury to a single person, $50,000 for bodily injury to multiple people, and $25,000 in property damage. Fault system - Insurance providers in Georgia will determine liability after a vehicle crash before offering coverage. The driver at fault is responsible for injuries and property damages as a result of the accident.  </p>

                <p class="content4"> <br>What Are The Main Causes Of Auto Accidents? Over the last 25 years, we have handled auto accidents in Atlanta that have been caused by any of the following things.  Distracted Driving – Here, the driver does not pay attention to the road while driving. The driver might be answering a call, texting, eating, reading, grooming and applying makeup or talking when driving resulting in an accident.  Drunk Driving – A lot of accidents in Atlanta have been caused by people who get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. <br>Speeding – Drivers who are running late, often tend to overspeed and will most likely cause an auto accident.  Reckless Driving – A reckless driver will usually change lanes too quickly or act aggressively while behind the wheel. If a driver is not calm behind the wheel, he/she will most likely cause serious accidents. Rain – If you don’t know how to drive in the rain, you should avoid it. That’s because it can cause slippery and treacherous road conditions. It’s ideal to wait for the storm to pass before getting back on the road again. <br>Running Red Lights – When you are on the road, you should always stop at red lights even if there aren’t other cares coming. By running a red light, you are increasing your chances of getting an accident and you will also be breaking the law. Driving At Night – It’s very difficult to drive at night because there is low visibility. If you must drive at night, make sure you are extra alert.  Design Defects – In some instances, accidents can be caused by flaws in the vehicle itself. It’s unpreventable bust very disastrous when it happens.<br>Tailgaiting – It refers to following the car in front of you very closely. While driving you need to stay a safe distance away from the vehicle in front of you to avoid any auto accidents especially in the event of sudden stops. Driving The Wrong Way Or Taking Improper Turns – A lot of drivers often make mistakes while on the road but having a lapse in judgment can result in a very serious accident. Failure to note the street signs especially for one-way streets or any other irregularities will result in an auto accident.  </p>

                <p class="content3">  <br>Injured individuals do not have the energy to argue. Moreover, some medications can make it difficult to think. An auto accident lawyer understands these subtle tricks and will be able to defend your rights. This can save you valuable time and money. The insurance company may even take advantage of your inexperienced state to get a settlement. So, you should always hire an auto accident lawyer who understands the nuances of insurance company's strategy.<br>Cost of hiring a lawyer - The cost of hiring an auto accident attorney depends on the type of accident and the lawyer. While small accidents may be settled by the parties involved, larger ones may require the services of a lawyer. Insurance companies may try to pressurize you into accepting an early settlement, so you may need to hire an attorney to fight against them. Your attorney will charge $100 - $500 per hour depending on the type of accident and the lawyer's experience.<br>The cost of an auto accident lawyer can run into the thousands of dollars, depending on the type of case and the jurisdiction. However, it shouldn't discourage you from filing a claim. Many law firms have different ways to charge accident costs. Large firms usually deduct the cost from the settlement, while smaller ones may require you to pay costs as they arise. You can negotiate payment terms with your lawyer, however, to ensure you pay the least possible amount.<br>A contingency retainer plan is a hybrid approach to payment for an attorney. In this case, a client pays a retainer to the lawyer before the case begins. The retainer, which is generally equal to 30% of the total settlement amount, is subtracted from the remaining amount. The retainer is essentially an advance on the case. If your case settles for USD $100,000, the lawyer will receive approximately $31,000, while you will get the remaining USD 14,000, or approximately $11,000 (depending on the lawyer).<br>Another way to reduce the cost of hiring an auto accident lawyer is to negotiate a settlement. Many insurance companies offer settlements for small settlements, which are often worth less than the attorney's fee. A settlement of $5,000 - $25,000 is usually enough to compensate a person for their injuries. If the insurance company is the at-fault party, it is important to seek compensation for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.<br>Benefits of hiring a lawyer -  A car accident lawyer has several benefits. For one thing, they know the law and can help you navigate the complex settlement process. Oftentimes, insurance companies will say that the injuries you have suffered are minor or are the result of an underlying condition. Hiring a car accident lawyer will help you avoid these situations and make the legal process easier to handle. An auto accident attorney can help you deal with insurance companies, which can be a daunting task.</p>
