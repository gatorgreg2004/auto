Avoid taking calls, texting, eating, reading or grooming yourself when behind the wheel. Never get behind the wheel when you are intoxicated. You can take a cab home or ask a friend to drive you home. Always stick to the speeding limits to avoid over speeding. You need to remain calm when driving to avoid any auto accidents caused by reckless driving.<br>When driving in terrible weather conditions, it makes sense to pull over and wait until the bad weather passes. Never run any red lights. You should always stop even if there are no other cars on the road. Avoid driving at night. Take your car for regular maintenance to identify any design effects before you cause a serious accident.<br>If you are a young driver, you should go through a defensive driving course and avoid using cell phones when driving. Also, you limit the amount of people in the vehicle when you are driving. Never drive when under the influence of drugs such as marijuana or prescription pills. Take note of all the signs on the road, especially animal crossings to avoid hitting animals when on the road.

The impact of the crash could have caused you to be prone to serious injuries. Whether or not the driver was not distracted from the phone, they could have been driving while beneath the influence or speeding simply because they were running late for work. Irrespective of what happened, we are going to work difficult to get to the bottom of it. Our law office takes all cases seriously.

We all do this because we would like to have all the evidence when we can find to back up any claim you happen to be making versus the other driver to acquire compensation to the damages.</p>

You may be unable to refuse this settlement or even dispute it. Furthermore, if you take the quick settlement, you may be unable to get the appropriate compensation from the insurance company. They may also try to twist your statements made at the scene of the accident to their advantage, such as saying that it was your fault.

As such, they know how to negotiate with the insurance provider, and they know how to deal with the attorney of the other party.

That is because the specifics of the cases are different in Atlanta. On the other hand, you can only file a lawsuit if the accident was a result of the other party’s negligence. Also, vehicle and car part manufacturers can be held liable for a car accident and even municipalities (road building and maintenance organizations). A driver can only be held liable; if they fail to exercise reasonable care. A few examples include: <br>Tailgating, Failing to obey traffic rules (such as red lights, stop signs, driving maximum speed, and others, Speeding, Driving while under the influence, Failing to keep an eye on the road and Failing to yield to traffic with the right of way.<br>The severity of the injury is another factor that determines if you have a case or not. According to Georgia law, those that meet specific car accident conditions can legally file a car accident claim. On the other hand, a victim can be able to recover compensation from their personal injury protection insurance policy. <br>What Do I Need To Know About Georgia’s Personal Injury Protection Insurance (PIP)? All drivers are required to have a Personal Injury Protection insurance; according to the traffic laws of Georgia. The best thing about PIP insurance is that it offers benefits to accident victims regardless of who was at fault for the accident. That is why it is also referred to as ‘no-fault’ insurance. The only condition to getting the benefits under the PIP insurance policy is – the victim must receive medical treatment within fourteen days. <br>Aside from getting insurance benefits that are more than $2,500, the victim must be receiving treatment for an emergency medical condition’. Georgia law defines an emergency medical condition as a medical condition that demands immediate medical attention and can reasonably be expected to be fatal to a victim’s health. Our lawyers will work closely with your insurance company to ensure that you get all the PIP benefits you are legally allowed. To know more about Georgia’s PIP programs, click here.   </p>
