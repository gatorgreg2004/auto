                <p> <br>What Are The Main Causes Of Auto Accidents? Over the last 25 years, we have handled auto accidents in Atlanta that have been caused by any of the following things.  Distracted Driving – Here, the driver does not pay attention to the road while driving. The driver might be answering a call, texting, eating, reading, grooming and applying makeup or talking when driving resulting in an accident.  Drunk Driving – A lot of accidents in Atlanta have been caused by people who get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. <br>Speeding – Drivers who are running late, often tend to overspeed and will most likely cause an auto accident.  Reckless Driving – A reckless driver will usually change lanes too quickly or act aggressively while behind the wheel. If a driver is not calm behind the wheel, he/she will most likely cause serious accidents. Rain – If you don’t know how to drive in the rain, you should avoid it. That’s because it can cause slippery and treacherous road conditions. It’s ideal to wait for the storm to pass before getting back on the road again. <br>Running Red Lights – When you are on the road, you should always stop at red lights even if there aren’t other cares coming. By running a red light, you are increasing your chances of getting an accident and you will also be breaking the law. Driving At Night – It’s very difficult to drive at night because there is low visibility. If you must drive at night, make sure you are extra alert.  Design Defects – In some instances, accidents can be caused by flaws in the vehicle itself. It’s unpreventable bust very disastrous when it happens.<br>Tailgaiting – It refers to following the car in front of you very closely. While driving you need to stay a safe distance away from the vehicle in front of you to avoid any auto accidents especially in the event of sudden stops. Driving The Wrong Way Or Taking Improper Turns – A lot of drivers often make mistakes while on the road but having a lapse in judgment can result in a very serious accident. Failure to note the street signs especially for one-way streets or any other irregularities will result in an auto accident. </p>

                <p class="yacss-text yacss-fonts-style mb-0 display-7"><p>While it might appear overwhelming to reply to so many questions, you must give us the maximum amount of information that you can. We wish to aid you with your case, so we need to understand how things occurred and who could have witnessed the accident firsthand. When you will find witnesses involved that will vouch for you personally and supply statements versus the other driver, this is a good thing since it makes it easier for us to prove that you are currently owed compensation through the other driver due to their wrongdoings. Several things can occur when different drivers are on the highway. A driver could decide to check out their phone while taking their eyes off the road for a couple seconds. However, during those matter of moments while they are failing to pay attention, that driver may have slammed right into your vehicle. The impact in the crash could have caused you to suffer from serious injuries. Even if the driver had not been distracted from the phone, they could have been driving while beneath the influence or speeding simply because they were running late for work. Regardless of what happened, we shall work challenging to the bottom of it. Our law firm takes all cases seriously. Concentrating on Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It After we have most of the details that you may have provided, we want to recreate the accident scene. We can easily enlist specialist help from experts that know how to reconstruct a model of your accident scene that shows how the vehicles were before, during, and just after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene would come with each of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that were posted on the intersection. The key reason for having the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of the happened and exactly how it happened. Surveillance footage is not always available when accidents occur, so the reconstructed scene is definitely the next smartest thing. If you have high-quality surveillance footage from the accident, it can be better yet. Given that more business owners and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras outside of their properties, it is easier than it was actually before to discover footage of your accident. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no guarantee that this accident was caught on camera, but we are going to work hard to find out if any one of the home owners in the region possess footage relating to the accident you have been involved in. We all do this because we wish to have the maximum amount of evidence since we can see to aid any claim you will be making up against the other driver to have compensation for that damages.</p>
