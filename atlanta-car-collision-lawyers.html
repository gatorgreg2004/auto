                <p class="yacss-text yacss-fonts-style mb-0 display-7"><p>While it may look overwhelming to respond to countless questions, you should provide us with as much information that you can. We want to support you with your case, so we must recognize how things occurred and who may have witnessed the accident firsthand. When there are witnesses involved that may vouch to suit your needs and offer statements versus the other driver, it is actually a a valuable thing since it makes it easier for people like us to prove that you will be owed compensation from your other driver because of their wrongdoings. A lot of things can happen when different drivers are on the highway. A driver could decide to look at their phone while taking their eyes off the road for a couple of seconds. However, during those few seconds while they are not paying attention, that driver could possibly have slammed right into your car. The impact from the crash may have caused you to be prone to serious injuries. Even if your driver had not been distracted with the phone, they could have been driving while under the influence or speeding simply because they were running late for work. Whatever happened, we shall work challenging to the base of it. Our lawyer takes all cases seriously. Working on Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It When we finally have most of the details that you may have provided, we would like to recreate the accident scene. We are able to enlist specialized help from experts that learn how to reconstruct a model from the accident scene that shows how the vehicles were before, during, and right after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene includes each of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that had been posted in the intersection. The principal reason for obtaining the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of the happened and how it happened. Surveillance footage is not always available when accidents occur, therefore the reconstructed scene will be the next most sensible thing. If there is high-quality surveillance footage in the accident, it is better still. Given that more companies and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras away from their properties, it is easier than it was before to discover footage of your accident. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no guarantee that this accident was caught on camera, but we are going to work difficult to find out if the homeowners in your community possess footage concerning the accident you were involved with. We all do this because we should have all the evidence as we can find to support any claim you happen to be making from the other driver to have compensation for the damages.</p>

Never run any red lights. You should always stop even if there are no other cars on the road. Avoid driving at night. Take your car for regular maintenance to identify any design effects before you cause a serious accident.<br>If you are a young driver, you should go through a defensive driving course and avoid using cell phones when driving. Also, you limit the amount of people in the vehicle when you are driving. Never drive when under the influence of drugs such as marijuana or prescription pills. Take note of all the signs on the road, especially animal crossings to avoid hitting animals when on the road. </p>

That is because the specifics of the cases are different in Atlanta. On the other hand, you can only file a lawsuit if the accident was a result of the other party’s negligence. Also, vehicle and car part manufacturers can be held liable for a car accident and even municipalities (road building and maintenance organizations). A driver can only be held liable; if they fail to exercise reasonable care. A few examples include: <br>Tailgating, Failing to obey traffic rules (such as red lights, stop signs, driving maximum speed, and others, Speeding, Driving while under the influence, Failing to keep an eye on the road and Failing to yield to traffic with the right of way.<br>The severity of the injury is another factor that determines if you have a case or not.

On the other hand, a victim can be able to recover compensation from their personal injury protection insurance policy. <br>What Do I Need To Know About Georgia’s Personal Injury Protection Insurance (PIP)? All drivers are required to have a Personal Injury Protection insurance; according to the traffic laws of Georgia. The best thing about PIP insurance is that it offers benefits to accident victims regardless of who was at fault for the accident. That is why it is also referred to as ‘no-fault’ insurance. The only condition to getting the benefits under the PIP insurance policy is – the victim must receive medical treatment within fourteen days. <br>Aside from getting insurance benefits that are more than $2,500, the victim must be receiving treatment for an emergency medical condition’. Georgia law defines an emergency medical condition as a medical condition that demands immediate medical attention and can reasonably be expected to be fatal to a victim’s health. Our lawyers will work closely with your insurance company to ensure that you get all the PIP benefits you are legally allowed. To know more about Georgia’s PIP programs, click here.  </p>
