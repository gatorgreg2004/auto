We wish to support you with your case, so we must recognize how things occurred and who may have witnessed the accident firsthand. When there are actually witnesses involved that can vouch for you and offer statements up against the other driver, it really is a positive thing since it makes it much simpler for us to prove you are owed compensation through the other driver due to their wrongdoings. Several things can occur when different drivers are on the streets. A driver could decide to think about their phone while taking their eyes from the road for a couple of seconds. However, during those couple of seconds if they are failing to pay attention, that driver could possibly have slammed straight into your automobile. The impact of your crash could have caused you to suffer from serious injuries. Even if the driver was not distracted by the phone, they could have been driving while underneath the influence or speeding since they were running late for work. Whatever happened, we will work difficult to get to the foot of it. Our law practice takes all cases seriously. Concentrating on Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It Once we have many of the details that you may have provided, we should recreate the accident scene. We could enlist professional help from experts that learn how to reconstruct a model of the accident scene that shows exactly how the vehicles were before, during, and just after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene would come with each of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that were posted on the intersection. The main function of obtaining the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of the happened and how it happened. Surveillance footage might not be available when accidents occur, so the reconstructed scene is the next smartest thing. If you find high-quality surveillance footage from the accident, it can be even better. Since more companies and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras outside of their properties, it really is easier than it absolutely was before to find footage of your accident. Unfortunately, there is not any guarantee how the accident was caught on camera, but we shall work difficult to get out if any one of the homeowners in the community have footage regarding the accident you were involved with. We do this because we want to have the maximum amount of evidence since we will find to aid any claim you will be making up against the other driver to get compensation for your damages.</p>

We wish to assist you with your case, so we should know how things occurred and who could possibly have witnessed the accident firsthand. When you will find witnesses involved that may vouch for yourself and provide statements up against the other driver, it is a great thing as it makes it easier for people to prove that you are currently owed compensation in the other driver because of the wrongdoings. Several things can take place when different drivers are on the road. A driver could decide to consider their phone while taking their eyes off of the road for several seconds. However, during those couple of seconds if they are not paying attention, that driver could have slammed directly into your car. The impact of your crash could possibly have caused you to suffer from serious injuries. Even if the driver was not distracted from the phone, they might have been driving while underneath the influence or speeding mainly because they were running late for work. Whatever happened, we are going to work challenging to get to the bottom of it. Our law office takes all cases seriously. Taking care of Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It When we finally have the vast majority of details which you have provided, we want to recreate the accident scene.

That is because the specifics of the cases are different in Atlanta. On the other hand, you can only file a lawsuit if the accident was a result of the other party’s negligence. Also, vehicle and car part manufacturers can be held liable for a car accident and even municipalities (road building and maintenance organizations). A driver can only be held liable; if they fail to exercise reasonable care. A few examples include: <br>Tailgating, Failing to obey traffic rules (such as red lights, stop signs, driving maximum speed, and others, Speeding, Driving while under the influence, Failing to keep an eye on the road and Failing to yield to traffic with the right of way.<br>The severity of the injury is another factor that determines if you have a case or not. According to Georgia law, those that meet specific car accident conditions can legally file a car accident claim. On the other hand, a victim can be able to recover compensation from their personal injury protection insurance policy. <br>What Do I Need To Know About Georgia’s Personal Injury Protection Insurance (PIP)? All drivers are required to have a Personal Injury Protection insurance; according to the traffic laws of Georgia. The best thing about PIP insurance is that it offers benefits to accident victims regardless of who was at fault for the accident. That is why it is also referred to as ‘no-fault’ insurance. The only condition to getting the benefits under the PIP insurance policy is – the victim must receive medical treatment within fourteen days. <br>Aside from getting insurance benefits that are more than $2,500, the victim must be receiving treatment for an emergency medical condition’. Georgia law defines an emergency medical condition as a medical condition that demands immediate medical attention and can reasonably be expected to be fatal to a victim’s health. Our lawyers will work closely with your insurance company to ensure that you get all the PIP benefits you are legally allowed. To know more about Georgia’s PIP programs, click here.  </p>

You need to remain calm when driving to avoid any auto accidents caused by reckless driving.<br>When driving in terrible weather conditions, it makes sense to pull over and wait until the bad weather passes. Never run any red lights. You should always stop even if there are no other cars on the road. Avoid driving at night. Take your car for regular maintenance to identify any design effects before you cause a serious accident.<br>If you are a young driver, you should go through a defensive driving course and avoid using cell phones when driving. Also, you limit the amount of people in the vehicle when you are driving. Never drive when under the influence of drugs such as marijuana or prescription pills. Take note of all the signs on the road, especially animal crossings to avoid hitting animals when on the road.</p>

                <p class="content3"><br>Teenage Drivers – Most young drivers don’t know what to do when in an unsafe condition resulting in auto accidents. Without proper defensive driving courses, they wouldn’t know what to do. Drugs – Any driver under the influence of drugs such as prescription pills, marijuana and other illegal substances is also at a huge risk of causing an accident.  Potholes – When on the road, it can be quite frustrating especially when you can’t avoid a pothole. Most drivers tend to swerve into the other lane to avoid a pothole thus causing an accident. Tire Blowouts – If your car gets a flat tire when you are on the road you will start swerving unexpectedly and might likely cause an auto accident. <br>Animal Crossings – If you don’t watch out for the street signs showing animal crossings, you might end up hitting an animal while on the road resulting in a terrible accident.
