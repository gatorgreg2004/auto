                <p> <br>What Are The Main Causes Of Auto Accidents? Over the last 25 years, we have handled auto accidents in Atlanta that have been caused by any of the following things.  Distracted Driving – Here, the driver does not pay attention to the road while driving. The driver might be answering a call, texting, eating, reading, grooming and applying makeup or talking when driving resulting in an accident.  Drunk Driving – A lot of accidents in Atlanta have been caused by people who get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. <br>Speeding – Drivers who are running late, often tend to overspeed and will most likely cause an auto accident.  Reckless Driving – A reckless driver will usually change lanes too quickly or act aggressively while behind the wheel. If a driver is not calm behind the wheel, he/she will most likely cause serious accidents. Rain – If you don’t know how to drive in the rain, you should avoid it. That’s because it can cause slippery and treacherous road conditions. It’s ideal to wait for the storm to pass before getting back on the road again. <br>Running Red Lights – When you are on the road, you should always stop at red lights even if there aren’t other cares coming. By running a red light, you are increasing your chances of getting an accident and you will also be breaking the law. Driving At Night – It’s very difficult to drive at night because there is low visibility. If you must drive at night, make sure you are extra alert.  Design Defects – In some instances, accidents can be caused by flaws in the vehicle itself. It’s unpreventable bust very disastrous when it happens.<br>Tailgaiting – It refers to following the car in front of you very closely. While driving you need to stay a safe distance away from the vehicle in front of you to avoid any auto accidents especially in the event of sudden stops. Driving The Wrong Way Or Taking Improper Turns – A lot of drivers often make mistakes while on the road but having a lapse in judgment can result in a very serious accident. Failure to note the street signs especially for one-way streets or any other irregularities will result in an auto accident. </p>

We would like to help you with your case, so we must recognize how things occurred and who might have witnessed the accident firsthand. When there are actually witnesses involved that could vouch for yourself and provide statements versus the other driver, it really is a great thing since it makes it easier for us to prove that you will be owed compensation from your other driver because of the wrongdoings. Numerous things can take place when different drivers are on the streets. A driver could decide to think about their phone while taking their eyes off of the road for a couple of seconds. However, during those few seconds if they are not paying attention, that driver might have slammed right into your vehicle. The impact of the crash might have caused you to be prone to serious injuries. Even when the driver was not distracted by the phone, they might have been driving while under the influence or speeding since they were running late for work. Irrespective of what happened, we will work challenging to get to the bottom of it. Our law firm takes all cases seriously. Taking care of Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It When we finally have many of the details you have provided, we wish to recreate the accident scene. We can easily enlist professional guidance from experts that learn how to reconstruct one of your accident scene that shows the way the vehicles were before, during, and just after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene would include all of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that were posted at the intersection. The primary purpose of obtaining the accident scene reconstructed is to supply a full visual of the items happened and just how it happened. Surveillance footage is not always available when accidents occur, so the reconstructed scene will be the next ideal thing. If there is high-quality surveillance footage of the accident, it is much better. Now that more company owners and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras away from their properties, it really is easier than it had been before to find footage of the accident. Unfortunately, there is not any guarantee that this accident was caught on camera, but we will work difficult to get out if the property owners in the area possess any footage relating to the accident you were involved with. We all do this because we would like to have all the evidence since we can find to back up any claim you might be making versus the other driver to acquire compensation for the damages.</p>

                <p class="content4"> <br>Non-economic or intangible losses are covered under general damages. You don't need to have proof of a specific amount of harm to claim these damages. You should prove the mental and emotional damages through medical documentation as well as testimony from expert witnesses. Examples of general damages are: Emotional suffering and distress,  Physical pain,  Mental anguish,  Diminished capacity to earn a living,  PSTD or post-traumatic stress disorder,  Lost quality of life,  and Missed opportunities in the workplace.<br>GA Auto Accident Laws -  The auto accident claim process looks different from state to state. You should consult the Atlanta Police Department if you or someone in your family is involved in an auto accident that results in more than $500 property damage, death or injury to any party. There are three locations in Atlanta where you can file your auto accident claim. The State Court of Fulton County has jurisdiction in all civil cases in Atlanta. If the claim is less than $15,000, you need to file your case with the Magistrate Court of Fulton County. <br>Car Insurance Needs - Every vehicle owner in Atlanta should have auto insurance with minimum requirements. The requirements include $25,000 for bodily injury to a single person, $50,000 for bodily injury to multiple people, and $25,000 in property damage. Fault system - Insurance providers in Georgia will determine liability after a vehicle crash before offering coverage. The driver at fault is responsible for injuries and property damages as a result of the accident.  </p>

                <p class="content3">  <br>Injured individuals do not have the energy to argue. Moreover, some medications can make it difficult to think. An auto accident lawyer understands these subtle tricks and will be able to defend your rights. This can save you valuable time and money. The insurance company may even take advantage of your inexperienced state to get a settlement. So, you should always hire an auto accident lawyer who understands the nuances of insurance company's strategy.<br>Cost of hiring a lawyer - The cost of hiring an auto accident attorney depends on the type of accident and the lawyer. While small accidents may be settled by the parties involved, larger ones may require the services of a lawyer. Insurance companies may try to pressurize you into accepting an early settlement, so you may need to hire an attorney to fight against them. Your attorney will charge $100 - $500 per hour depending on the type of accident and the lawyer's experience.<br>The cost of an auto accident lawyer can run into the thousands of dollars, depending on the type of case and the jurisdiction. However, it shouldn't discourage you from filing a claim. Many law firms have different ways to charge accident costs. Large firms usually deduct the cost from the settlement, while smaller ones may require you to pay costs as they arise. You can negotiate payment terms with your lawyer, however, to ensure you pay the least possible amount.<br>A contingency retainer plan is a hybrid approach to payment for an attorney. In this case, a client pays a retainer to the lawyer before the case begins. The retainer, which is generally equal to 30% of the total settlement amount, is subtracted from the remaining amount. The retainer is essentially an advance on the case. If your case settles for USD $100,000, the lawyer will receive approximately $31,000, while you will get the remaining USD 14,000, or approximately $11,000 (depending on the lawyer).<br>Another way to reduce the cost of hiring an auto accident lawyer is to negotiate a settlement. Many insurance companies offer settlements for small settlements, which are often worth less than the attorney's fee. A settlement of $5,000 - $25,000 is usually enough to compensate a person for their injuries. If the insurance company is the at-fault party, it is important to seek compensation for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.<br>Benefits of hiring a lawyer -  A car accident lawyer has several benefits. For one thing, they know the law and can help you navigate the complex settlement process. Oftentimes, insurance companies will say that the injuries you have suffered are minor or are the result of an underlying condition. Hiring a car accident lawyer will help you avoid these situations and make the legal process easier to handle. An auto accident attorney can help you deal with insurance companies, which can be a daunting task.</p>
