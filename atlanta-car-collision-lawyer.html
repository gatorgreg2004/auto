                <p class="content1 text-white blackPara"  >  <br>There is no actual way of understanding the damages that you should receive after an auto accident but based on our experience in handling auto crashes, our lawyers can tabulate the compensation that you should get. We will then fight relentlessly to ensure that you receive the restitution that you deserve. Should I Accept an Early Compensation Offer from The Insurance Company? After an accident, insurance companies know that you are at a low point emotionally and that you need money to pay for medical bills and sustain your family. As such, do not be surprised if they approach you with a cash offer in exchange for not filing a crash claim. At the law firm of Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C., we advise all our clients to reject the first compensation offer given by insurance companies. In fact, you should not even talk to the representatives of the insurance company. Instead, refer them to your lawyer. If you see an insurance company approaching you with an offer immediately after an auto crash, it is a sign that your case is worth much more.<br>Our lawyers have extensive experience in dealing with insurance companies. Let us deal with them as you recuperate. We will use the negotiating skills that we have honed over our years of representing auto crash victims to ensure that you are not short changed by insurance companies. As you are recuperating, you can be sure that we will be aggressively fighting to ensure that you get what is rightly owed to you.

A lot of things can happen when different drivers are on your way. A driver could decide to check out their phone while taking their eyes off the road for a couple seconds. However, during those few seconds if they are failing to pay attention, that driver may have slammed right into your car. The impact from the crash could possibly have caused you to be prone to serious injuries. Whether or not the driver was not distracted by the phone, they might have been driving while within the influence or speeding since they were running late for work. Regardless of what happened, we will work challenging to the foot of it. Our law firm takes all cases seriously.

We can enlist specialist help from experts that learn how to reconstruct one of the accident scene that shows exactly how the vehicles were before, during, and just after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene includes all the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs which were posted on the intersection. The primary function of obtaining the accident scene reconstructed is to provide a full visual of what happened and just how it happened. Surveillance footage may not be available when accidents occur, therefore the reconstructed scene is definitely the next most sensible thing. If there is high-quality surveillance footage in the accident, it can be even better. Since more business owners and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras away from their properties, it really is easier than it had been before to discover footage of your accident. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no guarantee that this accident was caught on camera, but we are going to work difficult to get out if the homeowners in the area possess footage concerning the accident you have been associated with. We do this because we want to have the maximum amount of evidence while we can discover to back up any claim you will be making versus the other driver to get compensation for your damages.</p>

Nugent, P.C., we value expert input, so that we can deliver the best.  <br>Negotiate With Insurance Companies – Do you know that a majority of personal injury cases are solved out of court?

                <p class="content4"> <br>Injured individuals do not have the energy to argue. Moreover, some medications can make it difficult to think. An auto accident lawyer understands these subtle tricks and will be able to defend your rights. This can save you valuable time and money. The insurance company may even take advantage of your inexperienced state to get a settlement. So, you should always hire an auto accident lawyer who understands the nuances of insurance company's strategy.<br>Cost of hiring a lawyer - The cost of hiring an auto accident attorney depends on the type of accident and the lawyer. While small accidents may be settled by the parties involved, larger ones may require the services of a lawyer. Insurance companies may try to pressurize you into accepting an early settlement, so you may need to hire an attorney to fight against them. Your attorney will charge $100 - $500 per hour depending on the type of accident and the lawyer's experience.<br>The cost of an auto accident lawyer can run into the thousands of dollars, depending on the type of case and the jurisdiction. However, it shouldn't discourage you from filing a claim. Many law firms have different ways to charge accident costs. Large firms usually deduct the cost from the settlement, while smaller ones may require you to pay costs as they arise. You can negotiate payment terms with your lawyer, however, to ensure you pay the least possible amount.<br>A contingency retainer plan is a hybrid approach to payment for an attorney. In this case, a client pays a retainer to the lawyer before the case begins. The retainer, which is generally equal to 30% of the total settlement amount, is subtracted from the remaining amount. The retainer is essentially an advance on the case. If your case settles for USD $100,000, the lawyer will receive approximately $31,000, while you will get the remaining USD 14,000, or approximately $11,000 (depending on the lawyer).<br>Another way to reduce the cost of hiring an auto accident lawyer is to negotiate a settlement. Many insurance companies offer settlements for small settlements, which are often worth less than the attorney's fee. A settlement of $5,000 - $25,000 is usually enough to compensate a person for their injuries. If the insurance company is the at-fault party, it is important to seek compensation for any losses you incur as a result of the accident.<br>Benefits of hiring a lawyer -  A car accident lawyer has several benefits. For one thing, they know the law and can help you navigate the complex settlement process. Oftentimes, insurance companies will say that the injuries you have suffered are minor or are the result of an underlying condition. Hiring a car accident lawyer will help you avoid these situations and make the legal process easier to handle. An auto accident attorney can help you deal with insurance companies, which can be a daunting task. </p>
