                <p class="yacss-text yacss-fonts-style mb-0 display-7"><p>While it may look overwhelming to reply to countless questions, you should give us all the information since you can. We would like to help you with your case, so we should know how things occurred and who may have witnessed the accident firsthand. When there are witnesses involved that may vouch for you personally and give statements up against the other driver, it is a good thing as it makes it easier for us to prove that you are owed compensation in the other driver because of their wrongdoings. Several things can occur when different drivers are on the streets. A driver could decide to look at their phone while taking their eyes off of the road for several seconds. However, during those couple of seconds while they are failing to pay attention, that driver could possibly have slammed directly into your car or truck. The impact from the crash might have caused you to suffer from serious injuries. Even if the driver was not distracted from the phone, they might have been driving while underneath the influence or speeding because they were running late for work. No matter what happened, we are going to work hard to get to the bottom of it. Our law firm takes all cases seriously. Taking care of Reconstructing the Accident to Prove Who Caused It After we have most of the details you have provided, we should recreate the accident scene. We could enlist specialist help from experts that learn how to reconstruct one from the accident scene that shows the way the vehicles were before, during, and immediately after the collision. The reconstructed accident scene includes each of the essential details, including any stoplights or stop signs that have been posted in the intersection. The key function of obtaining the accident scene reconstructed is to supply a full visual of what happened and the way it happened. Surveillance footage might not be available when accidents occur, so the reconstructed scene will be the next best thing. If there is high-quality surveillance footage of the accident, it is much better. Since more business people and homeowners are installing surveillance cameras away from their properties, it is actually easier than it absolutely was before to locate footage of your accident. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the accident was caught on camera, but we will work difficult to get out if some of the property owners in the region possess any footage relating to the accident you were involved with. Perform this because we should have the maximum amount of evidence while we can see to back up any claim you are making up against the other driver to acquire compensation for the damages.</p>

However, during those few seconds when they are failing to pay attention, that driver may have slammed right into your car or truck.

                <p class="content3"><br>What Are The Main Causes Of Auto Accidents? Over the last 25 years, we have handled auto accidents in Atlanta that have been caused by any of the following things.  Distracted Driving – Here, the driver does not pay attention to the road while driving. The driver might be answering a call, texting, eating, reading, grooming and applying makeup or talking when driving resulting in an accident.  Drunk Driving – A lot of accidents in Atlanta have been caused by people who get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. <br>Speeding – Drivers who are running late, often tend to overspeed and will most likely cause an auto accident.  Reckless Driving – A reckless driver will usually change lanes too quickly or act aggressively while behind the wheel. If a driver is not calm behind the wheel, he/she will most likely cause serious accidents. Rain – If you don’t know how to drive in the rain, you should avoid it. That’s because it can cause slippery and treacherous road conditions. It’s ideal to wait for the storm to pass before getting back on the road again. <br>Running Red Lights – When you are on the road, you should always stop at red lights even if there aren’t other cares coming. By running a red light, you are increasing your chances of getting an accident and you will also be breaking the law. Driving At Night – It’s very difficult to drive at night because there is low visibility. If you must drive at night, make sure you are extra alert.  Design Defects – In some instances, accidents can be caused by flaws in the vehicle itself. It’s unpreventable bust very disastrous when it happens.<br>Tailgaiting – It refers to following the car in front of you very closely. While driving you need to stay a safe distance away from the vehicle in front of you to avoid any auto accidents especially in the event of sudden stops. Driving The Wrong Way Or Taking Improper Turns – A lot of drivers often make mistakes while on the road but having a lapse in judgment can result in a very serious accident. Failure to note the street signs especially for one-way streets or any other irregularities will result in an auto accident.   </p>
