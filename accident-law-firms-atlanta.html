                <p class="content4"> <br>What Are The Main Causes Of Auto Accidents? Over the last 25 years, we have handled auto accidents in Atlanta that have been caused by any of the following things.  Distracted Driving – Here, the driver does not pay attention to the road while driving. The driver might be answering a call, texting, eating, reading, grooming and applying makeup or talking when driving resulting in an accident.  Drunk Driving – A lot of accidents in Atlanta have been caused by people who get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. <br>Speeding – Drivers who are running late, often tend to overspeed and will most likely cause an auto accident.  Reckless Driving – A reckless driver will usually change lanes too quickly or act aggressively while behind the wheel. If a driver is not calm behind the wheel, he/she will most likely cause serious accidents. Rain – If you don’t know how to drive in the rain, you should avoid it. That’s because it can cause slippery and treacherous road conditions. It’s ideal to wait for the storm to pass before getting back on the road again. <br>Running Red Lights – When you are on the road, you should always stop at red lights even if there aren’t other cares coming. By running a red light, you are increasing your chances of getting an accident and you will also be breaking the law. Driving At Night – It’s very difficult to drive at night because there is low visibility. If you must drive at night, make sure you are extra alert.  Design Defects – In some instances, accidents can be caused by flaws in the vehicle itself. It’s unpreventable bust very disastrous when it happens.<br>Tailgaiting – It refers to following the car in front of you very closely. While driving you need to stay a safe distance away from the vehicle in front of you to avoid any auto accidents especially in the event of sudden stops. Driving The Wrong Way Or Taking Improper Turns – A lot of drivers often make mistakes while on the road but having a lapse in judgment can result in a very serious accident. Failure to note the street signs especially for one-way streets or any other irregularities will result in an auto accident.  </p>
